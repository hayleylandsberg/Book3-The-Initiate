You have been tasked with building a list of email addresses for all of our customers, so we can spam them with email about Miffles the Vampire Weiner Dog.

Create a new project in workspace.
In your JavaScript file, define a variable named customers.
Copy the contents of the customers.json and make that object the value of customers.
From that object extract just the customers' email addresses and store them in a new array. You will need to use methods such as map(), forEach() and/or concat() to accomplish this.
